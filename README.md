By Wes Lord, Aaron Shaw, Max Ahn, Kelvin Lau, Robert Dall

Intro script written by Wes Lord:

We made a parody of the famous 1970 & 80's game Oregon Trail but based it in 2008's and called it Portland, Oregon Trail. Where we wrangle up an intrepid band of hipster adventurers at a poetry slam in Omaha Nebraska and set sail for the cooler pastures and fair trade organic coffee of Portland Oregon, In 2008, Before it was mainstream.
